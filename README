A fork from evercookie by Samy Kamkar.

The idea is to add a new "browserinfo" method to evercookie. The method creates a guid string from SHA-1 hashing various information about the client. This is information such as browser plugins (which are different between browsers and make this method not work cross browsers), screen resolution, screen ppi etc. It takes this guid and sends it to a server script (evercookie_browserinfo.php), which stores it on there server along with cookie name and value. If the cookie for the method is deleted it will restore it based on the guid.

Note that I haven't tested how unique this information is to each computer, so maybe this method doesn't work at all but I thought it was worth the shot... What could improve this is more info that can be gathered about the client and then of course combine this with the client's IP address.

If this works, and my guess is that this information is remarkably unique to each computer, than this will make evercookie survive even Chrome Incognito with a clearing of browser data.

evercookie 0.3 -- never forget.

The only files that need to be in your web directory are:
 evercookie.js
 evercookie_png.php
 evercookie_etag.php
 evercookie.swf

If evercookie_etag.php and evercookie_png.php are missing or
your server doesn't have PHP support, evercookie will still
function but without support for auto-generated PNG caching
or ETag caching.

If evercookie.swf is missing, evercookie will still function,
but without support for Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies).
